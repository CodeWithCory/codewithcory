A relational database, at its core, is just a group of tables that have something to do with one-another, like this:

Table Name: `animals_needing_homes`
<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>NAME</th>
    <th>SPECIES</th>
    <th>TEMPERAMENT</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>Howell</td>
    <td>Dog</td>
    <td>Friendly, but loud</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Hops</td>
    <td>Rabbit</td>
    <td>A bit jumpy</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
